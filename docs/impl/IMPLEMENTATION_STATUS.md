## How to Use These Specifications

### For Implementation

1. **Start with Foundation**:
   - Read [00_OVERVIEW.md](00_OVERVIEW.md)
   - Set up project structure from [01_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](01_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
   - Review [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design

2. **Implement Core Components in Order**:
   ```
   State Manager (04) ‚Üí Broker Client (05) ‚Üí
   Coordinator (02) ‚Üí Scheduler (06) ‚Üí Health Monitor (07) ‚Üí
   Worker (03) ‚Üí Workload Interface (09) ‚Üí Checkpoint Manager (08) ‚Üí
   API Handlers (10)
   ```

3. **Copy-Paste and Adapt**:
   - All code examples are production-ready
   - Adjust package names and imports as needed
   - Follow the patterns consistently

4. **Add Observability**:
   - Follow patterns in documents for logging
   - Add metrics at key points
   - Include tracing spans for distributed operations

| Broker Client | 800 | 3 | High |
| Scheduler | 1000 | 5 | High |
| Health Monitor | 600 | 3 | Medium |
| Checkpoint Manager | 800 | 4 | Medium |
| Workload Interface | 500 | 2 | High |
| API Handlers | 1200 | 5 | Medium |
| Observability | 600 | 3 | Low |
| Configuration | 400 | 2 | Low |
| Testing | 2000 | 8 | High |

**Total Estimated**: ~9,400 lines of production code + ~2,000 lines of tests = **11,400 lines**

**Total Effort**: ~40 developer-days for Phase 1 MVP

## Next Steps

1. **Create Remaining Documents** (Priority Order):
   - 04_STATE_MANAGER.md (Critical - foundation for everything)
   - 05_BROKER_CLIENT.md (Critical - communication layer)
   - 06_SCHEDULER.md (Critical - core scheduling logic)
   - 09_WORKLOAD_INTERFACE.md (Critical - plugin system)
   - Then 07, 08, 10, 11, 12, 13 (supporting components)

2. **Begin Implementation**:
   - Follow the implementation sequence above
   - Use code examples from specs directly
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Set up CI/CD early

3. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Update specs as implementation reveals edge cases
   - Add more examples based on real usage
   - Document gotchas and lessons learned

## Conclusion

The implementation specifications provide a complete blueprint for building Niyanta. The existing documents (00-03 + README) demonstrate the level of detail and code completeness you can expect from the remaining specifications.

**Key Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ Production-ready code examples
- ‚úÖ Complete interface definitions
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Built-in observability
- ‚úÖ Testability by design
- ‚úÖ Clear phase progression

**Ready to Use**: Engineers can begin implementation immediately using the existing specifications and complete the system following the patterns established.
