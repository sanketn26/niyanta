## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Database becomes bottleneck | High | Medium | Early load testing, read replicas, query optimization |
| NATS message loss during failures | High | Low | Use NATS JetStream for persistence (Phase 2) |
| Checkpoint size exceeds limits | Medium | Medium | Implement compression and S3 offload (Phase 4) |
| Worker failure detection too slow | Medium | Low | Tune heartbeat intervals, add active health checks |
| Multi-region data consistency issues | High | Medium | Defer to Phase 4, careful design of eventual consistency |
| Team availability/attrition | Medium | Medium | Cross-training, documentation, 2-person knowledge rule |

### Risk Monitoring

- Weekly risk review in team meetings
- Maintain risk register (spreadsheet or JIRA)
- Escalate high-impact risks to leadership
